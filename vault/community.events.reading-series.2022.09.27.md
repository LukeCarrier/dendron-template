[How I’m a Productive Programmer With a Memory of a Fruit Fly](https://hynek.me/articles/productive-fruit-fly-programmer/)

> Having *all* API docs one key press away is profoundly empowering.

The author talks about the transformative experience of using a native API Documentation browser when doing development work. 
While its true that documentation is accessible from the web, the experience of keeping a dozen tabs open at all times in order to reference them is jarring and has a high overhead.

The application the author highlights is Dash, a native mac app that allows users to pull up docs in a single keystroke and find the relevant docs in seconds. On the surface, this does not seem that different from searching on google, but the difference of a single keystroke (vs searching and clicking) and single digit seconds to find the results (vs multi digit seconds) is the difference between overwhelming to enpowering.

The quantity matters - the difference between the reaction taking place and not can be  a single milliliter of solvent. There is a similar analogy to be made for knowledge management and accessing information that is on the internet vs accessing something that you have available locally.
