## Summary

The Dendron Preview gives you a rich HTML preview for your notes. 

## Details

- when a note is open by clicking a link in the preview, that note will open in an editor group that is not the preview 
- the preview does not support scroll sync 

## Config

![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.config.preview#summary,1]]
![[Web|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.vscode.web]]
## FAQ
1. Can you pin a particular note's preview, and open a different preview pane for any notes opened thereafter? 
- We do not support it at the moment. However, as a temporary workaround, if the daily journal does not have too much Dendron-specific Markdown, you can use the built-in VS Code Markdown Preview in addition to Dendron's own preview.
