### Getting Started

To create a journal note, trigger a lookup and then click on the calendar icon, or use the `Ctrl+Shift+J`/`Cmd+Shift+J` shortcut (depending on operating system).

By default, Dendron will create the journal note with the following hierarchy `{domain}.journal.{y.MM.dd}`. `{domain}` is the **domain** of the current active note when you execute `New Journal Note`.
