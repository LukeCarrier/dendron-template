Most queries can be satisfied using [[lookup|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.lookup.find]], but sometimes you want to do a full text search across the **contents** of your notes. This can be done with `Search: Find in Files` (`Ctrl+Shift+F` / `Cmd+Shift+F`), which leverages VS Code [built-in search](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_search-across-files) capabilities.

## Troubleshooting

### Search only looks through open editors

Make sure you don't have the "Search only in open editor" toggle flipped on. See [here](https://www.loom.com/share/2585e130eef34ce486133f5e00fe670f) for details.
