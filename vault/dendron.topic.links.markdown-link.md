Markdown links can be used for local files and stuff on the internet (websites, images, blogs etc.). The `Markdown Shortcuts: Toggle hyperlink` command makes this operation really easy. You can even bind this to a shortcut key combination. We'd recommend using 'cmd/ctrl + K' to get the usual application behavior or 'cmd/ctrl + U' if you want to continue using ctrl+k as part of the usual VS Code combo operation.
